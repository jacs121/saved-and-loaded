## Common Mistakes

### Don't Do This

- Using Broken Syringe too early (wasted temporary health)
- Using Bloody Coin when you're already losing
- Adding Sniper Bullets when you're low on health
- Wasting Empty Chamber on favorable chambers

### Do This Instead

- Time Broken Syringe right before risky shots
- Use Bloody Coin when you have health advantage
- Save healing items for when you actually need them
- Use Empty Chamber strategically to avoid bad situations

## Technical Notes

- Items persist between rounds until used
- Poison damage and temporary health are tracked per player
- Sniper bullets are mixed randomly into chamber positions
- Coin flips use true randomness (50/50 chance)
- The dealer uses simplified AI for item usage
